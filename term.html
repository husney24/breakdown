      <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Effective Date]</p>

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        1.1 Welcome to Breakdown Recovery Near Me Ltd (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
        These terms and conditions (the “Terms”) govern the use of our services,
        including but not limited to mobile tyre fitting, vehicle recovery, and
        roadside assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.2 By accessing or using Breakdown Recovery Near Me services, you agree
        to these Terms. If you do not accept these Terms, please do not use our
        services.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Service Overview</h3>
      <p>
        2.1 Breakdown Recovery Near Me acts as a third-party intermediary,
        connecting customers with vetted and approved mobile tyre fitting and
        vehicle recovery providers across the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.2 Customers may request quotes by calling our hotline or visiting our
        website. Breakdown Recovery Near Me will then search its network to find
        the most suitable and cost-effective service provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.3 <strong>Important:</strong> A non-refundable deposit is required
        from customers to confirm and secure the services of the selected
        provider before any work is carried out.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Deposits</h3>
      <p>
        3.1 <strong>Deposit Requirement:</strong> A deposit must be paid to
        secure the services of the chosen provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.2 <strong>Non-Refundable Deposits:</strong> Deposits are strictly
        non-refundable if cancelled by the customer, regardless of the reason
        for the cancellation. This applies whether the job is cancelled by the
        customer or due to circumstances beyond our control. This policy is in
        place to protect our business and ensure commitment from the customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.3 <strong>No Refunds on Cancellations:</strong> If you cancel the job
        after paying the deposit, you will not be entitled to a refund. No
        exceptions will be made in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.4 <strong>Partial Refunds for Driver Failure:</strong> If the selected
        driver is unable to complete the job after the deposit is paid,
        Breakdown Recovery Near Me may, at its sole discretion, offer a partial
        refund. Such refunds are not guaranteed and will be assessed on a
        case-by-case basis.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Driver Details and Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        4.1 Upon receiving the deposit, Breakdown Recovery Near Me will provide
        you with the driver’s contact information and details for the selected
        service provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2 We are not responsible for any disputes that arise between the
        customer and the service provider after driver details have been
        provided. Once a deposit is paid and the service is arranged, the
        customer is responsible for liaising with the driver directly for any
        further requirements.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Service Provider and Customer Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        5.1 <strong>Customer Responsibility:</strong> It is the customer’s
        responsibility to provide accurate information about their vehicle and
        its condition. Any failure to disclose important details (such as
        whether the vehicle rolls or has mechanical issues) may lead to
        additional charges or a cancellation without a refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2 <strong>Provider Liability:</strong> Breakdown Recovery Near Me is
        not liable for the actions, performance, or services provided by the
        third-party recovery or tyre-fitting companies. Once the service
        provider has been assigned, any issues or complaints must be directed to
        them.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Charges and Payments</h3>
      <p>
        6.1 <strong>Payment Process:</strong> All payments, including deposits,
        must be made through the methods specified by Breakdown Recovery Near
        Me, which may include bank transfers, credit/debit cards, or other
        secure payment gateways.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.2
        <strong>Bank Transfers Preferred for Deposits Over £150:</strong> For
        deposits exceeding £150, we strongly recommend paying by bank transfer.
        This method offers more security for the customer and reduces the risk
        of disputes. Customers can request a refund from their bank in case of
        an issue, ensuring peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.3 <strong>Chargeback Prevention:</strong> We work hard to ensure
        clarity in our pricing and services. However, any customers initiating
        chargebacks fraudulently will be challenged, and we will submit all
        supporting evidence to defend against such claims.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Liability and Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>
        7.1 <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> Breakdown Recovery Near Me
        is not liable for any damages, losses, or additional costs incurred
        during or after the vehicle recovery or tyre fitting services. This
        includes, but is not limited to, delays, damages, or service provider
        failures.
      </p>
      <p>
        7.2 <strong>Vehicle Condition:</strong> Customers are responsible for
        ensuring their vehicle is suitable for recovery. Breakdown Recovery Near
        Me and its service providers are not liable for any pre-existing damage
        or issues with the vehicle.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h3>
      <p>
        8.1 <strong>Dispute Process:</strong> In the event of a dispute between
        the customer and Breakdown Recovery Near Me or its service providers,
        the customer agrees to first attempt to resolve the issue directly with
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.2 <strong>Arbitration:</strong> If a resolution cannot be reached, any
        disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration, under UK law.
        Court litigation is not an option unless required by law.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Changes to Terms and Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        9.1 <strong>Updates:</strong> Breakdown Recovery Near Me reserves the
        right to modify these Terms at any time. In the event of significant
        changes, we will notify customers via our website or other means.
        Continued use of our services after any such changes indicates your
        acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>
